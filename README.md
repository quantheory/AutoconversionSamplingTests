# AutoconversionSamplingTests

These notebooks contain tests of various sampling methods for Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithms. These algorithms are mainly used for test problems that
involve fitting a power law formula to autoconversion rate data, e.g. for use in
a bulk cloud microphysics scheme.
